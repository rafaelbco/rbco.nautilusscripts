Introduction
============

Installing
==========

1. Use Python's setuptools_ to install the package::

   This will install a set of scripts named ``nautilus_*`` into ``/usr/bin`` (or similar).

2. Run the ``rbco_nautilusscirpts_install`` script (also in ``/usr/bin``) to symlink the 
   ``nautilus_*`` scripts into the ``~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts`` directory.

   - Open Nautilus.
   
   - Go to File -> Scripts -> Open Scrips Folder.
   
   - Visit each folder and reload its contents to show the scripts.
